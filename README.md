# What is the project about & Why I started this project? 

I am currently working as an E-Commerce analyst at a consumer products company and I witnessed that implementing marketing strategies to “highly likely” to respond people contributes to cost minimization. Therefore I decided to implement a consumer segmentation project where I can find "Highly likey" to respond group.

# What I've done in the project. 

With propensity modeling through the feature importance analysis, I developed the algorithm to automatically choose the important features and analyze how these features are associated to the likelihood of the loan application. This was based on building the classifiers using logistic regression and random forest. 

# Interesting fact to know about this project 

Random Forest provided more accuate result than logistic regression.
