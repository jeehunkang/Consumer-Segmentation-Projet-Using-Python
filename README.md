# What is the project about & Why I started this project? 

I am currently working as an E-Commerce analyst at a consumer products company and I witnessed that implementing marketing strategies targeting likely customers contributes to cost minimization. Therefore I decided to work on a consumer segmentation project in which I can identify the "highly likey to respond" group.

# What I've done in the project

With propensity modeling through the feature importance analysis, I developed the algorithm to automatically choose the important features and analyze how these features are associated to the likelihood of the loan application. This was based on building the classifiers using logistic regression and random forest.
